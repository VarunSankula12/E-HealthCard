                                                        ABSTRACT

The E-Healthcard project is a robust healthcare management system that encompasses three crucial modules: Admin, Hospital, and User. The primary objective of this project is to streamline and enhance the administration of government-issued Arogyasree health cards, which entitle patients to discounts or even government-sponsored medical treatment in authorized hospitals. The project focuses on improving the validation and tracking of these cards, offering an effective solution for healthcare service management.

Admin Module:

The Admin module serves as the central authority responsible for overseeing the entire E-Healthcard system. Admin's key responsibilities include validating and granting permissions to prospective users and hospitals. Admin reviews and verifies user details, and upon approval, generates a health card for the user. This health card contains a balance, which represents the amount allocated by the government for medical expenses. Additionally, Admin is in charge of registering hospitals, ensuring that only authorized healthcare providers can accept Arogyasree cards, thus enhancing fraud detection and prevention.

User Module:

In the User module, individuals can register and apply for an Arogyasree health card. After registration, the user submits their application, which is reviewed by the Admin for validation. Once accepted, a health card is issued to the user, complete with a designated balance. Users can access this health card to avail themselves of discounted or free healthcare services in approved hospitals. The balance on the health card decreases as users utilize medical services, with the government replenishing the funds annually. Users also have the option to request card renewal. The renewal request is sent to the Admin for verification. If approved, the card's expiry date is extended to the next year, and the issue date is updated accordingly.

Hospital Module:

The Hospital module allows healthcare facilities to register within the E-Healthcard system. Admin is responsible for validating hospital applications, ensuring that only authorized hospitals can accept Arogyasree health cards. When a user visits a hospital and presents their health card, the hospital staff can validate the card to determine if it's authentic and still has a balance. This process safeguards against fraudulent claims and misuse of the health card system.

The E-Healthcard project seamlessly combines Java (JDBC), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Bootstrap to deliver an interactive and user-friendly healthcare management system. Hosted on an Apache Tomcat server, it provides a reliable and secure platform for healthcare service administration. This project enhances the efficiency and accountability of government-sponsored healthcare services while offering users the convenience of card renewal to extend the card's validity. It plays a crucial role in preventing fraud and improving healthcare access for eligible beneficiaries.
